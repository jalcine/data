/**
 * @mainpage Wintermute Data (WntrData) Documentation
 * Wintermute relies on the aggregation and pooling of data resources
 * to make sense of the (possibly) ten of hundreds of nodes of information
 * it recieves. There's dedicated systems to obtaining information regarding
 * syntax and linguistics for natural language processing (Wintermute::Data::Linguistics)
 * and ontological resources (Wintermute::Data::Ontology).
 * Currently, the language data system provides an abstract class system so that
 * plug-in developers can implement new and foriegn sources of data for lexical
 * and syntactic binding. Plug-in developers are encouraged to focus on data sources
 * that introduce new sources of words aside from importing new syntactic information
 * for the fact the syntactic system still needs a bit more work before it becomes as
 * decently mature as the lexical system.
 *
 * @section N01 Obtaining Information
 * WntrData holds all of the lexical, syntactical, and ontological data for Wintermute.
 * Thus, the means of information obtaining (at least for lexical and syntactic) information
 * are similar, whereas ontological information resembles a vaguely knit representation of
 * of that shown by typical SPARQL interpretators and parsers.
 * @subsection N011 Lexical Information
 * Lexical information is stored by using the Models system designed by Adrian Borucki <gentoolx@gmail.com>.
 * The syntactical information is also stored accordingly.
 * @see N012
 * @subsubsection N0111 Loading
 * Obtaining lexical information is done by creating a Data object and specifying the ID
 * and locale of the Data object. The symbol value is filled as well as the flags from the
 * loading
